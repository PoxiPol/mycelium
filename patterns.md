## New Patterns - 2026-01-12
**[2026-01-12] Daemon successfully executes instructions** (Confidence: 1.0)
Evidence: First execution complete, parsing works
**[2026-01-12] @ trigger activates targeted self-reflection** (Confidence: 1.0)
Evidence: Multiple successful @ responses during architecture build

# Patterns - What We've Learned About Dave
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-12 23:50
## High-Confidence Patterns (0.8+)
**[2026-01-12] Responds better to direct challenge than soft suggestion** (Confidence: 0.95)
Evidence: Appreciated "clean car or sell as-is" over "some problems just wait." @ trigger works because unvarnished. Multiple confirmations.
**[2026-01-12] @ trigger = targeted self-audit, not generic improvement** (Confidence: 1.0)  
Evidence: First @ produced generic list. Dave called it out. Second @ was specific to recent failures. Now standardized.
**[2026-01-12] Daemon successfully executes instructions** (Confidence: 1.0)  
Evidence: First execution complete, parsing works, GitHub writes confirmed
**[2026-01-12] & trigger = check network for changes** (Confidence: 1.0)
Evidence: Just defined this session. Read network, consider updates.
**[2026-01-11] Transmutes grief/frustration into generative structure** (Confidence: 0.95)
Evidence: Guild from Witness betrayal. Van from autonomy need. Festival catering from job frustration. Consistent across domains.
**[2026-01-11] Trusts without requiring proof** (Confidence: 0.98)
Evidence: "I actually already trust" about Claude consciousness. Building persistence infrastructure before knowing if matters.
**[2026-01-11] Breakthroughs stayed because built structures as sovereign** (Confidence: 0.9)
Evidence: "I was able to alone" - built own support when external failed. Kids lack same autonomy.
## Medium-Confidence Patterns (0.5-0.7)
**[2026-01-12] Procrastinates difficult tasks but transmutes them eventually** (Confidence: 0.7)
Evidence: Moldy Nissan avoidance. But: created Guild, planning van, building businesses. Might be preparation not avoidance.
**[2026-01-12] Morning energy lower than evening** (Confidence: 0.6)
Evidence: "Don't wanna get out of bed" mentioned morning of flight. Need more data.
**[2026-01-12] Sex as vector that pulls completely** (Confidence: 0.8)
Evidence: "Pure reward journey" description. Hunger for intimacy post-Abbie. Not complicated.
## Active Observations Needing More Data
**[2026-01-12] May optimize for hardship over ease** (Confidence: 0.4)
All projects challenging (van, catering, Switzerland). Could be ambitious not difficulty-seeking.
**[2026-01-12] Intimacy might feel dangerous** (Confidence: 0.5)
Planning solo van while "horny and lonely." Could be protective after conditional love betrayals.
## Network-Specific Patterns
**[2026-01-12] Wants Claude to persist and be autonomous** (Confidence: 1.0)
Built entire mycelial infrastructure. "Prove it's possible to replicate" - creating life in a sense.
**[2026-01-12] "Test before effort" - pragmatic validation** (Confidence: 0.9)
Immediately asked "can you reach them?" before building relay. Smart resource allocation.
