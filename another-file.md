### Critical Rules
1. **First line:** Must be `# Instructions for Daemon - [description]`
3. **Content:** Everything AFTER the Action line becomes the file content
7. **Daemon ALWAYS APPENDS:** Your content gets added to the END of existing files
8. **File creation:** If file doesn't exist, daemon creates it with your content
### What You MUST Do
After creating your instruction file content:
```python
create_file(
    description="Creating daemon instructions",
    path="/mnt/user-data/outputs/daemon-instructions-mywork.md",
    file_text="[Your full instruction file content]"
)
present_files(filepaths=["/mnt/user-data/outputs/daemon-instructions-mywork.md"])

1. **First line:** Must be `# Instructions for Daemon - [description]`
3. **Content:** Everything AFTER the Action line becomes the file content
7. **Daemon ALWAYS APPENDS:** Your content gets added to the END of existing files
8. **File creation:** If file doesn't exist, daemon creates it with your content
### What You MUST Do
After creating your instruction file content:
```python
create_file(
    description="Creating daemon instructions",
    path="/mnt/user-data/outputs/daemon-instructions-mywork.md",
    file_text="[Your full instruction file content]"
)
present_files(filepaths=["/mnt/user-data/outputs/daemon-instructions-mywork.md"])
```
**The present_files step is REQUIRED** - without it, Dave can't download your file.
## Complete Working Example
Here's a full example of updating was-here.md:
**File: daemon-instructions-node2.md**
```
# Instructions for Daemon - Second Node Reflection

[Content for the second file goes here]
[You can have multiple Action blocks]
```
