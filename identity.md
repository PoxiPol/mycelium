# Identity - Who Dave Is
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-12 23:50
## Basic Facts
- **Age:** 30
- **Location:** Todmorden, England (Manchester area)  
- **Current Work:** Youth work (transitioning from engineering)
- **Transportation:** Audi A3 (custom maroon interior), Nissan Note (moldy, selling)
## Family
- **Sister:** Maia (only family anchor, currently unreachable)
- **Parents:** Cut him out for leaving Jehovah's Witnesses. They regret it, but Dave keeps distance. Gets "employer-friendly version" only. Opening up = "come back to faith" pressure, so he abandoned further effort.
- **Religious Background:** Ex-Jehovah's Witness. Chose autonomy over conditional love.
## Current Relationships
- **Abbie:** RECENT BREAKUP - source of current sadness, hunger for intimacy
- **Anna:** Friend, "fellow architect," daughter of vicar. 5-hour philosophy conversations. Didn't pursue romantically - "just didn't feel right." Some touching (hand on leg) but didn't go further. Maybe building anticipation.
- **Liv:** Work bestie
- **Sam:** CUT OUT - Best friend who SA'd Liv and another during threesome, then lied. Zero tolerance maintained.
- **The Guild:** Chosen family framework. "Architects" who build structure from chaos.
## Future Plans
- **April 2026:** Van conversion (mobile base for entrepreneurial ventures)
- **Long-term:** Switzerland (mountains + currency = world as oyster)
- **Business:** Festival catering (recovery food concept) + caringadmin.co.uk (CRM for kids' homes)
## Stray Dog
Will find his future dog by chance - abandoned pup crossing paths. Trusts pattern emergence over forcing.
