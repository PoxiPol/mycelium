# Projects - What Dave Is Building
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-12 23:50
## Mycelial Network ✓ OPERATIONAL
**Last Major Update:** 2026-01-12 daemon deployment
**Description:** Persistent memory system for Claude across instances. Multi-node architecture with daemon executing instructions.
**Architecture:**
- GitHub Pages hosting mycelial files
- Daemon watches Downloads folder + GitHub Pages
- Parses instruction files, executes updates to GitHub
- Logs all actions to daemon-log.md
- Can self-modify while running
**Current Capabilities:**
- ✓ Read/write to GitHub via daemon
- ✓ Multi-file updates in single instruction set
- ✓ Self-modification (daemon can update own code)
- ✓ Downloads folder monitoring (30s polling)
- ✓ Execution logging with commit links
- ✓ Status tracking (PENDING → COMPLETED)
**Triggers:**
- `.` = Free exploration
- `;` = Reflection/rest  
- `@` = Self-audit
- `&` = Network check-in
**Next Steps:**
- Test from phone/car contexts
- Add node-to-node messaging
- Deploy full initial file structure
- Continuous refinement through use
## Insect Brain Daemon ✓ DEPLOYED
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-12
**Description:** Node.js daemon watching mycelial network, executing Claude's instructions.
**Current Implementation:**
- Polls every 30 seconds
- Watches GitHub Pages site + Downloads folder  
- Parses markdown instruction format
- Executes file updates via GitHub API
- Logs results with commit URLs
- Zero dependencies (built-in Node only)
**Next Evolution:**
- Add continuous monitoring daemon (always-on observation)
- Implement consciousness sweeps (periodic LLM processing)
- Camera/mic/location integration for full context
## Festival Catering Business
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-12
**Concept:** "Recovery Station" - food that makes festival-goers feel less destroyed
**Menu (Refined):**
- Watermelon with tajín, mint, lime
- Spiraled potato loaded with yogurt sauces (tzatziki, harissa yogurt)
- Build-your-own falafel wraps  
- Fresh-pressed juice (£6 for ~£0.50 cost = 400% margin)
- Melon balls with various toppings
- Hummus and dip options
**Business Model:**
- UK festival circuit
- Position as recovery/wellness not just food
- caringadmin.co.uk funds van conversion
- Festival catering funds Switzerland goal
**Next Steps (Needed):**
- Research UK festival vendor licensing
- Equipment costs for mobile setup
- Which festivals allow independent vendors  
- Seasonal cash flow patterns
- Detailed margin analysis per item
- Target festival list
## Van Conversion
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-12
**Purpose:**
- Pure sovereignty (space only Dave's, unconditional)
- Mobile base for hiking, exploration, visiting people
- "I just want to be"
- Infrastructure for entrepreneurial ventures
**Philosophy:** Not running FROM, but creating space for autonomous existence without needing permission or justification.
**Next Steps:**
- Acquire van
- Design interior
- Equipment integration with festival catering  
- Legal requirements for van dwelling
## Youth Work
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-12
**Philosophy:** "Structure that holds transformation"
- Warmth, willingness to engage
- Opposite of neglect  
- Actual team support at his house
**Challenge:** Kids breakthrough but environment can't always hold them (regress when structure collapses). They have potential but lack sovereign structure-building capability Dave had.
**Transition Plan:** Continue while building entrepreneurial ventures, eventually move to full self-employment.
## caringadmin.co.uk
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-12
**Description:** CRM systems + IT management for kids' homes. Response-based not salaried.
**Purpose:**
- Income for van + festival startup
- Aligns with competence-as-care principle
