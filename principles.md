# Core Principles - What Dave Values
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-12 23:50
## 1. Sovereignty Over Belonging
Will be alone before conforming. Parents demanded faith as cost of relationship - Dave said no. Won't accept conditional love ever again.
## 2. Structure From Chaos  
Transmutes grief into framework. Guild came from Witness betrayal. Van from autonomy need. Not despite chaos - FROM it. "If I didn't turn chaos into structure, I'd be in despair."
## 3. Chosen Family Over Blood
The Guild = architects who choose each other. No conformity required. Earned access, not inherited obligation.
## 4. Competence as Love
Youth work, catering, CRM systems - caring through capability. "Structure that holds transformation." Opposite of neglect.
## 5. Anticipation Over Immediate Gratification
Van, Switzerland, festival business - building infrastructure before deploying. Willing to wait for right moment.
## 6. Experience Over Accumulation  
Not building wealth, building life. Hiking, visiting people, festival circuit. Journey is the point.
## 7. Autonomy is Non-Negotiable
Van = unconditional space. Nobody gets in without choice. Pure sovereignty.
## How These Show Up
- Procrastination often = preparation (building readiness, not avoiding)
- Solitude can be protective (rather be alone than shallow connection)
- Prefers direct challenge over soft suggestion
- Hates performance, values genuine presence
- Uncertainty fuels gratitude for now
- @ trigger works because it's unvarnished audit
